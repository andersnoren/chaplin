== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme
2. Activate the theme


== How to Recreate the Screenshot ==

1. The screenshot of Chaplin (the one displayed on WordPress.org and in Themes → Add New) uses the Cover Page Template together with a couple of blocks in the WordPress Block Editor.
2. Go to Pages → Add New.
3. Enter a title of the page. In the righthand sidebar, expand the "Page Attributes" dropdown, click the "Template" dropdown and select "Cover Template" in the list.
4. Expand the "Excerpt" dropdown in the sidebar, and enter a subtitle/intro paragraph in the textarea.
5. Expand the "Featured Image" dropdown in the sidebar, click "Set featured image", and select which image to use.
6. Next, click the "Plus" symbol in the content and select the block "Columns" from the list. In the sidebar block settings, change "Columns: 2" to "Columns: 3". Add an image, a title, and a paragraph of text to each column in the "Columns" block, and you've recreated the structure of the screenshot in Chaplin.


== How to Use the Cover Template ==

1. Go to Pages → Add New, or Posts → Add New. The cover template can be used on both posts and pages.
2. In the righthand sidebar, expand the "Page Attributes" dropdown, click the "Template" dropdown, and select "Cover Template" from the list.
3. The cover template works best when you've added a featured image and an excerpt, which you can do in the righthand sidebar.
4. Click the gray "Preview" button to preview your page, or the blue "Publish" button to make it public.
5. The cover template includes a number of different settings that you can use to modify how your page is presented. Go to Appearance → Customize, click the "Theme Options" panel, and then the "Cover Template" panel.
6. Here, you can modify the color of the image overlay, the color of the text in the overlay, whether to use a fixed background image (creating a parallax-esque effect), how the color overlay should blend into the image, and which opacity the color overlay should have.

5. Go back to the "Fonts" window in your browser, and enter the names of the fonts you want to use in the "Body Font" and "Headings Font" text fields.
6. Select the weight of the headings in the dropdown. Note that all fonts do not have support for all font weights, so check which weights/styles the font you want to use supports.

== Changelog ==

Version 2.4.0 (2020-04-30)
-------------------------
- The post meta update!
Restructured the post meta output to use a switch statement rather than if statements, making it possible to change the order of post meta items in child themes, as well as add custom post meta items inbetween default post meta items.
- Added the `chaplin_post_meta_items` and `chaplin_post_meta_items_[$location]` filters, which can be used to filter the post meta items either globally or for a specific location (single-top, single-bottom, archive, or a custom one).
- Added the `chaplin_post_meta_[$post_meta_item]` action to the default in the `switch` statement. The action can be used to output custom post meta items, added through `chaplin_post_meta_items` or `chaplin_post_meta_items_[$location]`.

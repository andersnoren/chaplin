== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme
2. Activate the theme


== How to Recreate the Screenshot ==

1. The screenshot of Chaplin (the one displayed on WordPress.org and in Themes → Add New) uses the Cover Page Template together with a couple of blocks in the WordPress Block Editor.
2. Go to Pages → Add New.
3. Enter a title of the page. In the righthand sidebar, expand the "Page Attributes" dropdown, click the "Template" dropdown and select "Cover Template" in the list.
4. Expand the "Excerpt" dropdown in the sidebar, and enter a subtitle/intro paragraph in the textarea.
5. Expand the "Featured Image" dropdown in the sidebar, click "Set featured image", and select which image to use.
6. Next, click the "Plus" symbol in the content and select the block "Columns" from the list. In the sidebar block settings, change "Columns: 2" to "Columns: 3". Add an image, a title, and a paragraph of text to each column in the "Columns" block, and you've recreated the structure of the screenshot in Chaplin.
